# FlowForge AI Roadmap

## Q4 2025

- **Flow Templates**: Ship JSON schema definitions and gallery UX for one-click imports.
- **Execution Timeline**: Visualize step durations, token usage, and costs.
- **Branching Support**: Add conditional steps with expression rules.
- **Mock Provider SDK**: Allow community to define deterministic mock responses per step type.

## Q1 2026

- **Plugin SDK**: Extend beyond prompt stepsâ€”add tool invocation, retrievers, custom code.
- **Eval Runner**: Compare flows against golden datasets and produce leaderboards.
- **Team Workspaces**: Multi-user flows with access control and saved history.
- **Desktop Packaging**: Distribute via Tauri for offline-first environments.

## Backlog Ideas

- Vector store integrations (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector)
- Webhook triggers and scheduled runs
- Flow diffs with semantic summaries
- AI-assisted flow authoring
