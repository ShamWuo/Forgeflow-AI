# Contributing to FlowForge AI

Thank you for helping build FlowForge AI! This guide explains how to propose features, file bugs, and submit PRs.

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set your keys.
4. Run `npm run dev` and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Branching & Commits

- Base all work on `main` and use feature branches named `feature/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>`.
- Keep commits scoped and descriptive. Use imperative mood (e.g., `Add flow execution logger`).
- Reference issues in commit bodies (e.g., `Refs #42`).

## Code Style

- TypeScript for all new code.
- Components live under `components/`, domain logic under `lib/`.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` before opening a PR.
- Prefer functional components with hooks and avoid default exports unless required.

## Pull Requests

- Fill in the PR template (generated automatically) with context and screenshots.
- Add tests for new features when possible. We welcome Vitest and Playwright coverage contributions.
- Tag maintainers or community reviewers if you need input.
- Be ready to iterateâ€”collaboration is the goal.

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests

- Use GitHub Issues with the provided templates.
- Include reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, environment details, and logs where possible.
- Tag issues with labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`) to help triage.

## Community Values

- Assume positive intent, provide actionable feedback, and celebrate wins together.
- Respect the Code of Conductâ€”everyone deserves a safe environment to contribute.

Happy building! ðŸš€
